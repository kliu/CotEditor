<h1>Change File Drop preferences</h1>

<p>In the CotEditor app <img class="appicon" src="../../Shared/gfx/icon_16x16@2x.png" height="16" alt=""/> on your Mac, use File Drop preferences to choose how to insert a preset text when you drop a file onto your document window. To change these preferences, choose CotEditor &gt; Preferences, then click File Drop.</p>

<p>For example, you can automatically insert the <code>img</code> tag into your HTML document by dropping an image file from Finder. </p>
